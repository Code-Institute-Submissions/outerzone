An ode to the skyline; a symphony for the local legends; a tapestry of downtempo dreamscapes - from Shawlands to Neuk√∂lln and the world beyond. A warm dose of future-proof emotion. Strap in, this is one for heads, the lovers and all those along the way. Welcome to the layer cake son.",

Having cut his teeth DJing as a relatively unnoted (but well loved by those in the know) local in Berlin for 10 years, one could argue that by the time success knocked on his door, he was more than ready for playing the international stage. It was during these 10 years of obscurity when he refined his craft to become the singular DJ he is now.",

I'm not really into narrow thinking. Making this music is like poker. You begin with five cards. You don't play poker with two cards. That's just the rule of the game. Once you learn how to play you can bend the rules.",
